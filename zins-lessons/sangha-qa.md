1. Community Newcomer Fear

When joining new community, newcomers face an inherent risk of public community backlash (even silent) when saying something. This instinctual fear blocks newcomers to open up, request support and contribute. Reducing community engagement and total network value.

A senior member needs to initiate the conversation privately and slowly guide new members into the community through incentives, support, and opportunities. But, a senior member has limited capacity.

Can an AI do that? Can an AI be that Senior member to guide newcomers into the community?

**Answer:** 

In Buddhist scriptures, in the newly formed monastic order, the older members didn't guide the newcomers, so the newcomers caused many problems to surrounding community.

The scriptures record that the Buddha required older members to guide the new members, creating a teacher-student relationship. In this way they will respect, esteem, and be considerate toward each other, and they will grow and reach greatness on this spiritual path This teacher-student relationship is fair; the teacher makes mistakes, and the student points them out.

Artificial Intelligence may not be able to replace older members in fostering respect and consideration, but it can assist older members in guiding new members.

2. AI fostering peer-to-peer learning
There are different levels of expertise in the community. A member is both a master in some topics and a novice in others.
