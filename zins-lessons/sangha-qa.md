1. Community Newcomer Fear

When joining new community, newcomers face an inherent risk of public community backlash (even silent) when saying something. This instinctual fear blocks newcomers to open up, request support and contribute. Reducing community engagement and total network value.

A senior member needs to initiate the conversation privately and slowly guide new members into the community through incentives, support, and opportunities. But, a senior member has limited capacity.

Can an AI do that? Can an AI be that Senior member to guide newcomers into the community?

**Answer:** 

In Buddhist scriptures, in the newly formed monastic order, the older members didn't guide the newcomers, so the newcomers caused many problems to surrounding community.

The scriptures record that the Buddha required older members to guide the new members, creating a teacher-student relationship. In this way they will respect, esteem, and be considerate toward each other, and they will grow and reach greatness on this spiritual path This teacher-student relationship is fair; the teacher makes mistakes, and the student points them out.

Artificial Intelligence may not be able to replace older members in fostering respect and consideration, but it can assist older members in guiding new members.

2. Newcomer Hindrances

As I communicate with newcomers, I observe different kinds of hindrances in their observation. These hindrances prevent them from seeing their own problems clearly, thus unable to find solutions or want to request help from others.

    * No need to observe
    * Unable to observe specifically
    * Unable to observe clearly
    * Unable to observe with focus
    * Cling to suffering observations

How to help newcomers overcome these hindrances? Can AI help here?

**Answer:** 

In Buddhist scriptures, the Buddha taught of The Five Hindrances:
    
    * Sensual Desire (*kāmacchanda*): Being "blinded by sensual pleasures," like a man caught in a net.
    * Ill Will (*vyāpāda*): A mind clouded by hate, which is compared to boiling water where you cannot see your own reflection.
    * Dullness and Drowsiness (*thīna-middha*): Mental sluggishness that makes the mind "obscure" and "deep," like water covered in moss and algae.
    * Restlessness and Remorse (*uddhacca-kukkucca*): An agitated mind, compared to water whipped by the wind into waves.
    * Doubt (*vicikicchā*): Indecision, compared to muddy water or being lost in a "forked path" in a forest. 

These hindrances make newcomers unable to see their own problems clearly, thus unable to find solutions or want to request help from others. The Buddha taught of the way to overcome these hindrances, knowingly The Seven Factors of Awakening:

    * Mindfulness (*sati*): Observe the present moment without judgment, realizing problem exists.
    * Investigation of Phenomena (*dhammavicaya*): Analyzing and understanding the problem.
    * Energy (*viriya*): Diligent effort in analyzing and finding solutions.
    * Joy (*pīti*): A sense of happiness and well-being when getting better.
    * Tranquility (*passaddhi*): A calm and peaceful state of mind when analyzing and finding solutions.
    * Concentration (*samādhi*): The ability to focus the mind when analyzing and finding solutions.
    * Equanimity (*upekkhā*): Willingness to let go of the clinging to problem roots.

AI is reactive, not proactive. It can help offer different angles of observation to newcomers, helping them with new perspectives and insights. But, AI can't replace the role of older members in guiding newcomers.
