Five Point of Human Value in the Age of AI
1. Now: AI is replacing Human in many jobs.
2. AI strength: AI Body and Mind can execute and analyze at scale.
3. AI weakness: AI Body and Mind can't feel Right from Wrong.
4. Human strength: Human Consciousness guides Right Actions.
5. Human value: Human Consciousness guides AI Body and Mind towards Right Actions.

## Mission Statement
Our Network State believes in Human Value, believes in Human Consciousness, believes in Human Innovations.

For thousands of years, our Curious Consciousness lead us to understand the world, our Compassion Consciousness lead us to help ourselves and others, our Wisdom Consciousness show us new ways to help at scale using our deep observation of the world. Without Consciousness, we would be like animals, existing only to breed and without the will to evolve.

Our Consciousness is our unique gift, our unique strength, our unique value.

That is why we want to cultivate Human Consciousness, to double down on what makes us unique, to invent new ways to help people at scale and understand the world more deeply. This is not a time for our Consciousness to be afraid of AI, of War, of Sufferings. This is a time for our Consciousness to be bold, be brave, be curious, be compassionate, be wise.

## ZINS Development Plan
ZINS Development Plan is a long-term plan to build a Network State for ZINSians. All plans will be open-sourced to establish trust and transparency.

1. Re-examine Lord Buddha's discovery of the community structure of Sangha, the first ever DAO. This is first ever durable Network State spanning multiple countries, which has survived and thrived for thousands of years.
2. Utilize blockchain technology to re-create on-chain Sangha, inhereting thousands of years of proven wisdom of the community structure of Sangha.
3. Leverage existing pagodas as sanctuaries for ZINS, providing support in ZINS values, accelerating Right Innovations (AI, Blockchain, Quantum Computing, etc)
4. Found dedicated cities for ZINSians to live, work, and raise their families in Da Nang and Bhutan.
